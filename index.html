											<h3>Software Development Intern at SpaceX</h3>
											<p><em>Hawthorne, CA | May 2021 - Aug 2021</em></p>
											<p>During my internship at SpaceX, I used my skills in Software Development and knowledge of physics to produce data based automations. The product was able to extract live sensor data and classify what course of action the engine need to take. The product also provided users with visualizations, building more confidence within the novel product. By the end of the internship, I was able to scale up the product so that it could be used across the entire company for different space vehicle programs.</p>
											<p><strong>Key Skills:</strong> Python, Docker, Software Automation, Version Control</p>
